# hello-world

Hello,

I've been working in the IT industry for over 12 years. My experience with programming is mostly HTML, CSS, and some PHP. I decided to start the journey of learning to program. I am unsure at the current moment if Developement is where I want to go. So far I've completed a beginner courses for Java and Python. I just signed up for a course that covers Git and GitHub, so I started by updating my account (set it up a while back but never really used much. Anyways, I'm excited to see where things go from here.
