# hello-world

Hello,

My name is David Martinez. I've been working in the IT industry for over 12 years. My experience with programming is mostly HTML, CSS, and some PHP. I recently decided to start the journey of learning Java. I setup my first GitHub account in hopes that it would become a place to store ideas, resources and discuss things with others.
